# Deep learning for image classificatin and NLP

This folder contains two project for the courses:
* [cs231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu) : Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition.
* [cs224d](http://cs224d.stanford.edu)(2015): Deep learning for natural language processing.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you set up for running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
